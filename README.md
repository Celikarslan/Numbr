# Numbr
Numbr is a Wordle type game where the goal is to guess a number by getting each digit one at a time.
However the catch is that the numbers are colored based on if they are less than or more than the correct number with blue being less than and red being more than the correct number.
Player gets 5 tries to get the number and the correct number is revealed at the end whether the answer is correct or not.
Very simple game created using python and the rich library.
